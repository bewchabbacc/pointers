# pointers
Series of pointer use demos

This is a presentation on Pointers and Memory in C++03, for programmers with basic understanding of C++ and other object oriented programming language (such as Java)
It contains a presentation that should take under an hour to complete at a decent pace.

Feel free to use these slides, but please aknowledge they are not yours! I took quite some time to make them both thorough and condensed to fit in a small presentation.

Sincerely,

Bewchy (aka S.G.)
